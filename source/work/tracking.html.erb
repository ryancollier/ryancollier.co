    <h1>Tracking Health and Wellness Programs</h1>

    <p class="lead">Healthentic wanted to increase user engagement with the Population Health Dashboard reporting product. After going back to the drawing board, we discovered an unmet need that could also increase customer-product interactions, so we designed a tracking feature to match.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As a user experience designer for Healthentic, I managed this project from end-to-end. I was responsible for research and discovery, final prototypes, UI documentation, and the story backlog for development. I worked collaboratively with product mangers, subject matter experts, and executives along the way. Product and design team members contributed to interviews, analysis, journey mapping, and prototyping. </p>
     
        
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Healthentic&rsquo;s Population Health Dashboard provided a great deal of reporting in a simple, easy to use package. It solved the problem of untimely, disparate health data for human resource administrators and benefit managers. Although customers regularly renewed the service each year, usage was sporadic. The business goal of this project was to increase engagement, but finding a viable product strategy to meet this goal meant we needed to learn more about the users current behaviors, understand their journey.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I screened, recruited, and conducted interviews (ethnography) to learn about benefits planning. Using a set of question prompts, our team learned about a yearly planning cycle used to make health benefit changes, plan modifications, or implement new programs (e.g. health and wellness programs). We organized the data collected and developed a customer journey map we could use for analysis and to open up communication with the entire Healthentic team about our customers.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4"><figcaption><span class="title">Journey Map.</span> <span class="caption-body">Research was organized and synthesized using a customer journey map. In the interviews, we asked participants to describe how they have implemented, tracked, and measured a health or wellness program in the past. After a few interviews we started hearing repeated themes in the process. Quotes were later transcribed and organized along three dimensions&mdash;do, feel, and want&mdash;and within the themed steps that participants described.</span></figcaption></div>

        <p class="indent">Through this research we learned that users had a difficult time tracking their benefit changes and programs year-over-year. They kept detailed spreadsheets, but they were only marginally usable in the context of benefit planning. This presented an opportunity to solve a problem that was both consistent with users' past behaviors and could meet the goal of increasing meaningful interactions with the product. </p>

        <p>Our hypothesis was that users wanted a way to quickly and consistently understand health outcomes related to their programs and benefit changes. We would create tracking function would allow users to quickly capture their changes, events, and programs to catalog and visualize them against their live data. This would give users a reason to regularly login and use the Population Health Dashboard. Before getting totally immersed in the design of the new feature, I wrote a short form creative brief to get the team on the same page. This provided a way to keep the project focused on the key user scenarios at the forefront of our design work.</p>

        <p class="indent">I iterated from white board sketches and paper prototypes all the way to requirement and implementation, increasing in fidelity as we moved toward a solid version of the design. There were lots of challenges I had to address, such as the variable data availability and the existing implementation of “time periods” within the product. While difficult, these problems provided constraints that would help focus the design on the highest priority user scenarios. As the design progressed, I did cognitive walkthroughs with customers and our internal team to ensure we were on track, making changes as needed.</p>

            <p class="indent">This product change also introduced a new level of &ldquo;drill in&rdquo; functionality that would be available throughout the application. To address these, I also had to consider the broader implications for the information architecture of the product. How would the addition of event tracking impact data displays on the product dashboard or influence important user tasks we were already supporting?</p>

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>218 tracking events were captured by users in just the first two and half months after the feature was made available in Q3 2014. </p>
