    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>When I started at Healthentic I was coined a UX/Product Manager. I was employee number 13, so I really got to define my roll and learn my way into a good fit. It was exciting, scary, and daunting all at once. I had the awesome opportunity to work on product and design strategy, be immersed in an Agile/Scrum development cycle, serve as product owner, build lots of prototypes, interview customers, and manage the UX process. I worked a long side a very smart, talented team. I led much of the UX for the Population Health Dashboard product and surrounding product and design efforts.</p>
 
    
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Anyone who has done user experience work in an Agile/Scrum environment knows how difficult it can be to size, scope, and fit design work and deliverables into a precise cycle. The paradox is that user-centered design approaches are very much iterative; I&rsquo;ve found that the challenge is getting to the big picture through the short incremental cycles of the development process.</p>

    <p>I felt certain the team could build products that technically worked and would be functionally usable. But how do we really focus on <em>experience</em>? This challenge is pervasive, evidenced by the abundance of training and workshops aimed at helping designers assimilate! To boot, Healthentic built health informatics products aimed at non-technical people. This meant getting to feasibility&mdash;let alone everything we wanted focus on&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t easy.  Three tactics that were effective for the Healthentic team was to get ahead, test early and often, and go light on documentation.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>I followed a basic process, but there were often new problems that required new approaches. With such a wide variety of tools in the UX toolbox, it always makes sense to pull out the best tool possible for the job at hand. Nonetheless, I established a general approach that we followed which started with getting at least one sprint ahead of the development team. And there were many cases we had to be working months, if not a quarter ahead.</p>

    <h4>Getting Ahead</h4>
    <p>Getting ahead meant we had to have a good view into the product road map and strategy. Our product management and design team reviewed the road map and developed a high-level game plan to deliver prioritized items. We would start by assessing new product work and build basic work back plans for each major milestone. This gave the team the ability to take a guess at the project and design approach. Often, at this stage we would write some likely user scenarios and do some sketches to think through the design problem as a team. We would start working on this along side the development of the road map.</p>   

    <h4>Test Early and Often</h4>
    <p>Testing early and often could mean a lot of different things at Healthentic. First, feasibility was almost always a big question that needed to be evaluated. We strived to create the ideal user experience, but we had to do this within the constraints of the messy heath claims data our product used. It was effective to engage our clinical team in prototyping exercises and design activities early so we could work a problem together. This would help us rapidly arrive at something feasible and reasonable given the challenges. </p>

    <p>Using what we learned about the feasibility, we would move quickly to put this in the context of customers. I developed good relationships with our Account Management team so I could quickly connect with customers to do a test or walk through of our early prototypes. For these, I would use our scenarios to come up with specific tasks or open ended questions. This early input provided tremendous value and yielded actionable outcomes quickly.</p>


    <h4>Light Weight Documentation</h4>
    <p>Light weight documentation was my response to the timing and fluidity of ever-evolving requirements, designs, and data constraints. The last week of each sprint during my first six months on the job were filled with 12-hour days as I scrambled to codify each interaction, requirement, and detail of the user interface behaviors into a static document. I always got the requirements and documents &ldquo;done&quot;, but I was often discouraged when the off-shore team building the UI implemented it in a way I could have never imagined. This was a good lesson for me. It was a problem I had been fully aware of, yet I still fell for immersing myself completely in the delivery of documents.</p>

    <p>As any good &lsquo;UXer&rsquo; would do, I considered this problem and started experimenting with our approach until arriving at a workable compromise that met the needs of my audience (our team, developers) and would help us go faster and be more productive. Eventually we started building and communicating around highly-functional prototypes. The process didn&rsquo;t change much&mdash;start with lo-fidelity mockups or sketches&mdash;but where we ended up did change. Instead of delivering comprehensive documents we would deliver functional, clickable prototypes in code. What couldn&rsquo;t be communicated by the artifact itself was written up in a requirement and the entire package was versioned.</p>

    <p>Of course, it is always a work in progress and there were plenty of occasions we just couldnâ€™t help but to create detailed documents. The important thing was that I spent less time documenting and more time designing. This approach worked well for our team and processes.</p>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Our design and product management processes had tremendous success. Stakeholder, developers, and executives enjoyed being a part of the process early on; our off-shore team benefited from our functional prototypes which reduced churn. All in all, we were able to successfully release major updates quarterly with smaller enhancements throughout the cycle.</p>
