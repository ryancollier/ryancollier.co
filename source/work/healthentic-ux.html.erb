    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>When I started at Healthentic my title was UX/Product Manager. I was employee number 13, so I really got to define my roll and learn my way into a good fit. It was exciting, intimidating, and challenging all at once. I had the awesome opportunity to work on product and design strategy, be immersed in an Agile/Scrum development cycle, serve as product owner, build lots of prototypes, interview customers, and manage the UX process along side a very smart, talented team. I led much of the UX projects for the Population Health Dashboard product and surrounding product and design efforts.</p>
 
    
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Anyone who has done user experience work in an Agile/Scrum environment knows how difficult it can be to size, scope, and fit design work and deliverables into a precise cycle. The paradox is that user-centered design approaches are very much iterative; I&rsquo;ve found that the challenge is getting to the big picture through the short incremental cycles of the development process.</p>

    <p>I was certain our team could build products that technically worked and would be functionally usable. But how do we really focus on <em>experience</em>? This challenge is pervasive, evidenced by the abundance of training and workshops aimed at helping designers assimilate! To boot, Healthentic built health informatics products aimed at non-technical people. This meant getting to viability and feasibility&mdash;let alone everything we wanted focus on&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t always easy. Three tactics that were effective for the Healthentic team was to get ahead, test early and often, and go light on documentation.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>I followed a basic process, but there were often new problems that required new approaches. With such a wide variety of tools in the UX toolbox, it always made sense to pull out the best tool possible for the job at hand. Nonetheless, I established a general approach that we followed which started with getting at least two sprints ahead of the development team. And there were many cases we had to be working ahead by months, if not more.</p>

    <h4>Getting Ahead</h4>
    <p>Getting ahead meant we had to have a good view into the product road map and strategy. I participated with the other designers and product managers in reviewing the road map and developing a high-level game plan to deliver prioritized items. We would start by building a work plan for each project or milestone (Healthentic called these &lsquo;story breakdowns&rsquo; and &lsquo;epics&rsquo;, respectively). This gave the team the ability to take a guess at the project and design approach. </p>

            <div class="col-md-4"><figcaption><span class="title">Story Breakdown.</span> <span class="caption-body"> This document was used to capture a high level description and acceptance criteria for a project. The product, engineering, and design teams worked together to construct an outline of the work required to complete the project. This was tremendously helpful as an input for the product road map and work estimation.</span></figcaption></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Often, at this stage we would write some out some of the key user scenarios and do some sketches to think through the design problem as a team. We would start working on this early to inform the ever-evolving road map.</p> 

    <h4>Test Early and Often</h4>
    <p>Testing early and often could mean a lot of different things at Healthentic. First, feasibility was almost always a big question that needed to be evaluated. Our goal was to create the ideal user experience, but this had to be done within the constraints of the messy heath claims data our product used.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="title">Sketch and Notes.</span> <span class="caption-body"> This was a sketch I did with one of our clinical researchers as we worked through the details of a new report on maternity and motherhood for the Population Health Dashboard. Health data is messy, so spending time with subject matter experts was an essential part of turning complex data into something a non-technical user could use and understand.</span></figcaption>

    <p class="indent">It was effective to engage our clinical team in prototyping exercises and design activities early so we could work a problem together. This would help us rapidly arrive at something feasible and reasonable given the challenges.</p>

    <p>Using what we learned about the feasibility, we would move quickly to put together an artifact that we could review and evaluate with customers and stakeholders. I developed good relationships with our account management team so I could quickly connect with customers to do a test or walk through of an artifact. For these customer meetings, I would use scenarios to come up with specific tasks or open ended questions. This early input provided tremendous value and yielded actionable outcomes quickly.</p>

    <h4>Light Weight Documentation</h4>
    <p>Light weight documentation was my response to the timing and fluidity of ever-evolving requirements, designs, and data constraints. The last week of each sprint during my first six months on the job were filled with 12-hour days as I scrambled to codify each interaction, requirement, and detail of the user interface behaviors into a static document. I always got the requirements and documents &ldquo;done&quot;, but I was often discouraged when the off-shore team building the UI implemented it in a way I could have never imagined. This was a good lesson for me. I had been fully aware of the potential for this problem, yet still fell for immersing myself completely in the delivery of documents.</p>

Because our developers could see and touch the actual content and functionality, our documentation could be abbreviated. I documented the user task flows and included user scenarios and business objectives along with the prototype (<span class="visible-md-inline visible-lg-inline">right</span><span class="visible-xs-inline visible-sm-inline">bottom</span>).</span></figcaption>

        <p>As anyone might do, I considered this problem and started experimenting with our approach until arriving at a workable compromise that met the needs of my audience (our team, developers) and would help us go faster and be more productive. Eventually we started building and communicating around highly-functional prototypes. The process didn&rsquo;t change much&mdash;start with lo-fidelity mockups or sketches&mdash;but where we ended up did change. Instead of delivering comprehensive documents, we would deliver functional, clickable prototypes in code. What couldn&rsquo;t be communicated by the artifact itself was written up in a requirement and the entire package was versioned.</p>

        <p>Of course, it is always a work in progress and there were plenty of occasions we just couldn&rsquo;t help but create detailed documents. The important thing was that I spent less time documenting and more time designing. This approach worked well for the Healthentic team and processes.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Our design and product management processes had tremendous success. Stakeholder, developers, and executives enjoyed being a part of the process early on; our off-shore team benefited from our functional prototypes which reduced churn. All in all, we were able to successfully release major updates quarterly with smaller enhancements throughout the cycle.</p>
